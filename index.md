## About The Project
Trying to bring newer versions of Ubuntu to the Wii has been a project of mine for a while. Many trial and errors.
This versions actually build somewhat off of [Wii-Linux-NGX](https://github.com/neagix/wii-linux-ngx)
But this version uses the same bootloader with a different kernel, a newer one. And it also boots Ubuntu instead of Debian 8.


## How To Boot
You will load up the homebrew channel to see its empty, thats normal. Simply press the home button and click "Launch BootMii"
That will instead load a bootloader known as Gumboot. More on Gumboot [here](https://neagix.github.io/gumboot/).
In order to select a different item in gumboot you MUST have a gamecube controller plugged in. But, thankfully it will auto boot in 30 seconds.
