## About The Project
Trying to bring newer versions of Ubuntu to the Wii has been a project of mine for a while. Many trial and errors.
This versions actually build somewhat off of [Wii-Linux-NGX](https://github.com/neagix/wii-linux-ngx)
But this version uses the same bootloader with a different kernel, a newer one. And it also boots Ubuntu instead of Debian 8.


## How To Boot
You will load up the homebrew channel to see its empty, thats normal. Some new and beta releases will have an option there, booting that will do nothing. To boot, simply press the home button and click "Launch BootMii"
That will instead load a bootloader known as Gumboot. More on Gumboot [here](https://neagix.github.io/gumboot/).
In order to select a different item in gumboot you MUST have a gamecube controller plugged in. But, thankfully it will auto boot in 30 seconds.

## Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) was released on 21 April 2016 and introduced us to snaps, a more secure app format, with faster and simpler updates, as well as LXD, the pure-container hypervisor and OpenStack Mitaka.

Is Ubuntu 16.04 LTS still supported?
Yes, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS is supported until 2026 through Canonicalâ€™s Expanded Security Maintenance (ESM) product. Xenial entered the ESM period in April 2021, with security patches for five additional years, beyond the five years of standard support.

## Ubuntu Wii Betas

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver) was released on 23 April 2018, introducing improved UEFI Secure Boot, broader Kernel Livepatch coverage, GNOME instead of Unity on Ubuntu Desktop, LXD 3.0 and OpenStack Queens.

Ubuntu 18.04 is still supported but this is a custom made version of Ubuntu 18.04 so its not using official sources and may not have any updates.
