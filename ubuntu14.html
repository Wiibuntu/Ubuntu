  <p>This is the Image File for Ubuntu 14 PowerPC and it has been modified to boot on the Nintendo Wii.</p>
    <p>That file will two partitions: a fat32 partition and a ext4 partition. The fat32 partition will contain the Linux loader for the Homebrew Channel.</p>
    <p>Just flash this image to an SD Card (2GB or more needed!)</p>

    <p>(Image Outdated)</p>     

  <p>You will see an errors have been found at / dialog, im no pro, so I did most likely mess something up, but press I on a keyboard to ignore this and continue to boot.</p>

  <p></p>Please download the "Whiite-ez-wifi-config" when you download the .img file and you will need to get that file over to your wii. If you cant get the file over to the Linux filesystem, you will have to do "sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces" and add your wifi informantion manually.
  <p></p>If wlan0 gets stuck on DOWN, this is an issue with wpasupplicant. Please downgrade to the .DEB provided. This will allow you to connect to wifi and upgrade to a stable version of wpasupplicant.

  <h1>Known Issues And Fixes</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>-libc6 package is an unstable version, In order to properly install and upgrade things you MUST downgrade libc6 with aptitude to version 2.19-0ubuntu6.</p>
    <p>-More packages happen to be unstable, thankfully aptitude can help you solve that problem and downgrade them (even in batches) just keep requesting a new solution until one includes downgrading the packages causing problems.</p>
    <p>-Sometimes on reboot WLAN0 will not connect by itself (after setting up wifi for the first time). To fix that just so the command "sudo ifdown wlan0" and then "sudo ifup wlan0". If the command hangs and goes on forever press Crtl+C, Most of the time it already has an IP address and is UP but this is a bug. Use the command "ip addr" to verify.</p>
